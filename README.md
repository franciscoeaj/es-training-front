### Setup
The only thing you'll need to run the application is a server.

Good thing is, if you're already on Linux and have Python installed (almost all distros have it by default) you only need to run the command:
```
sudo chmod +x serve.sh && ./serve.sh
```
That will make *serve.sh* executable then it will ~~guess what~~ execute it. *serve.sh* start Python's SimpleHTTPServer on port 4200.

If you do not have Python or don't want to use SimpleHTTPServer you can install any other server.
